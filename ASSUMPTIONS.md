## General Assumptions

1. **Task Structure**: Each task is assumed to have a unique `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, and `dueDate`.
2. **Status Values**: The task status can only be one of the following: "Pending", "In Progress", or "Completed".

## User Interaction Assumptions

1. **Editing Tasks**: When a user clicks "Edit" on a task, the corresponding task details will be pre-filled in the form. If no task is selected, the form will be empty.
2. **Task Deletion Confirmation**: A confirmation dialog will appear before a task is deleted to prevent accidental deletions.
3. **Search Functionality**: The search feature is case-insensitive and matches both the title and description of tasks.

## Data Storage Assumptions

1. **Local Storage**: Task data is stored in the browser's local storage to persist user data across page reloads.
2. **Initial Data**: If there are no saved tasks in local storage, the application will load a set of dummy tasks for the user.

## Filtering and Sorting Assumptions

1. **Filtering Tasks**: The task list can be filtered by status (All, Pending, In Progress, Completed) and is combined with the search query.
2. **Sorting Tasks**: Tasks are sorted by due date in either ascending or descending order as selected by the user.

## User Experience Assumptions

1. **Form Validation**: The form will display errors if required fields (title and due date) are not filled out properly before submission.
2. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, but specific breakpoints and designs for various screen sizes have not been implemented.

## Future Considerations

1. **Task Reordering**: Currently, drag-and-drop functionality has not been implemented. Future versions may reintroduce this feature for improved task management.
2. **User Authentication**: Future addition may include user accounts to manage tasks across different devices.
